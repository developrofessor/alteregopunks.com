            üé≠The Alter Ego Punks is a unique collection of 1,000 hand crafted NFTs that reside on the avalanche blockchain. All NFTs will be listed on NFTrade. Each Alter Ego Punk has its own persona that correlates with our personalities! We all have a side to us that we show the public, show the ones closes to us and the side we don‚Äôt show anyone! The Alter Ego Punks is a direct representation of that! Each Alter Ego Punk is unique in its own way!
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠There will be 4 series and five listing stages each series. Each series will have 250 NFTs listed at a time. 10 representatives from each crew totaling 50 NFTs, will be listed each stage.
            <br />
            <br />
            Stage 1 = 50 NFTs 20%<br />
            Stage 2 = 50 NFTs 40%<br />
            Stage 3 = 50 NFTs 60%<br />
            Stage 4 = 50 NFTs 80%<br />
            Stage 5 = 50 NFTs 100%<br />
            <br />
            Red backgrounds will represent the fire crew.<br />
            Blue backgrounds will represent the water crew.<br />
            Green backgrounds will represent the earth crew.<br />
            Yellow backgrounds will represent the energy crew.<br />
            White backgrounds will represent the air crew.<br />
            <br />
            All stages will have the same 5 different colored backgrounds for every 10 NFTs that will represent what crew you fall into!<br />
            <br />
            üé≠ Each stage will have different unlockables for the community! Unlockables such as Avalanche coin, T-shirts, crewnecks and sweaters that will be shipped directly to where you‚Äôre located. 1 NFT holder from each crew will be randomly selected after each stage is completed. If you do not want a physical item and want to give it away to another holder or to someone who's homeless, that is optional. Each winner will be randomly selected by a wheel spin. Every holder of a Alter Ego Punk will be entered into this giveaway by their metamask wallet address. All giveaways will be held in the community discord!
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ After 50 Alter Ego Punks are minted from each stage, 2.5 avax will be airdropped directly to 5 holders of the collection. 5 holders will receive .5 avax each!
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ Once 250 NFTs from each series of the collection has been minted. 1 NFT holder from each crew will be randomly selected by a wheel spin to have their Alter Ego Punk printed onto a canvas and shipped to where you‚Äôre located. If you‚Äôre selected as a winner and don‚Äôt want a canvas, you can give this option to another community member or I will use the money to feed the homeless. (Please verify this with me upon doing so). Also, 10 Physical items will be airdropped to holders!
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ Each Alter Ego Punk NFT minting price will be 0.25 #AVAX
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ Every Friday a community AMA will be held in the discord.
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠Everything will be documented via Twitter, YouTube and Discord.
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ 1 holders from each crew will have the option after all 5 stages are complete, to have your NFT made into a figurine. Once the first version of the collection is minted, I will hire a 3D designer to complete this task!
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠ All the art and graphic designs is created and edited by me via photoshop. All the merchandise is created by me and my sister. I have the Embrilliance Stitch Artist Level 3 Software where I digitize the designs. Also, I have the brother pe 800 embroidery machine where we transfer the designs digitally onto the clothing. I go through a company to print the art onto canvases.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once all five stages are completed and minted from the first version of the collection, we will be continuing this collection with The Altered Ego Punks V2!
            <br />
            <br />
            I am matching out of my personal finances triple times the total amount of what the first and second versions of the collection raise to purchase land in Florida. By the 3rd quarter of 2022 I will be looking to purchase 1-5 acres in Florida (depending on pricing for acres) of land for homesteading and farming.
            <br />
            I'm predicting before the 4th quarter to secure the land, I already contacted some real estate agents in different sections of Florida already. Once the land is secured, I will be launching a YouTube channel documenting the entire process as well as teaching everything I know and learn about off grid living, self sustainability, farming, dieting, survival methods, canning, recipes, animals, nature and much more.
            <br />
            All long term holders of the project will automatically be subjected to receiving fresh produce bundle packages that include vegetables, fruits and organic seeds üì¶. We are going to grow a lot of out of the ordinary vegetables and fruits! Also, once the base area for the house and farm is structured and livable, which I'm predicting somewhere in the 4th quarter of 2022/1st quarter of 2023, collection holders will randomly be selected for vacation trips to stay on the land for a week (Flights all paid for).
            <br />
            By the 4th quarter of 2022 we will still be working on the living structure and the farm. If all goes as planned, have the farm up and running and have already started planting the vegetables and fruits.
            <br />
            Another one of my plans with the property is to build a animal sanctuary where all different types of animals can live their best life's and I will rescue a lot of animals from shelters or that are stray! I am a vegan I just felt like I had to add that in there lol. My family and friends will be assisting me with this task.
            <br />
            <br />
            üé≠I plan on bringing legitimacy to the community and connect everyone together as one through our project.
            <br />
            Also, we want to bring awareness and shine light on the importance of health and self sustainability! I understand life can get busy and you might not have the time to look into these things so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for! Without our health everything we do wouldn‚Äôt be possible! Especially in these times we‚Äôre living in, self sustainability is very important and my goal is to make sure I provide the necessary tools and knowledge that‚Äôs needed to make that possible!
            <br />
            üé≠I created a section in this discord where I will be breaking down step by step of how exactly I will be securing the land to start the farm and building the self sufficient ecosystem and what I will need to do so! The section is called ‚ÄúOFF-GRID-STEP-BY-STEP‚Äù
